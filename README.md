Welcome to the **HTML_CSS_Mastery** repository! This is my self-driven journey to master HTML and CSS by building 10 responsive projects. Each project in this repository represents a step forward in my learning process, tackling different aspects of web development, from layout design to advanced responsive techniques.

## Projects

This repository contains the following projects as submodules:

### 1. **Project 1**
